# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology plan is meant to provide accessibility for students to learn coding with ease of availability of needed devices and electronic accessibility, in-person support, and online resources while also applying the foundational concepts of Mathematics like Statistics.


## Context

### Course

This course introduces statistical analysis and computer science principles (coding).  Using inquiry-driven lessons, students are encouraged to ask critical questions about their world, create surveys, and collect data using technology and mobile devices.  Students will analyze and visualize data using the “R” programming language.  By the end of this course they will have explored and participated in the four stages of the Data Cycle: (1) ask a statistical question, (2) collect data, (3) analyze data, and (4) interpret data. 

Introduction to Data Science is available to 11th-12th grade students as a math course and elective.


### Situation

This course was originally designed by IDS UCLA for students who have already taken high school Statistics in mind, however my school district has made this accessible to all juniors and seniors so Statistics is not a prerequisite.

For the vast majority of students entering this class, this is the first comprehensive student experience in coding. With many novice coders, students who have not had a foreknowledge of Statistics from the course, and individuals who have had discouraging experiences in the Integrated Math 1 and Integrated Math 2 courses, IDS has become the most tangible and relatable the juniors and seniors will experience. Another significant concern has been making this course more accessible for our Special Education students and our English Learners since all of the IDS classes follow an inclusion model. 

With the inexperienced coders as well as the Special Education students and English Learners in mind, my school district has provided all the relevant technology along with the support of our collaboration teachers and instructional aides, but it is the guidance and human interaction that will connect our students to this worthwhile course by initially turning juniors and seniors into participatory sensors. Motivation and interest is stirred up based on the design of this curriculum, but connecting our students to coding R-language coding platform known as Rstudio has taken a bit of time. Students, depending on their own comfort levels have had varying lengths of time to get accustomed to doing the lab work. Collaboration among students working in pairs and one-on-one between the teacher or aide and the coder will be among the strategies to be utilized. For our English learners, the collaboration pairing will be crucial to overcome some of the language barriers as well as the understandable cultural adjustment to a new setting.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

For the Introduction to Data Science course, online software is accessible through the school district’s participation in an IDS partnership managed by the IDS and UCLA team.
### Minimum and Necessary Requirements

- There are two primary software tools used in IDS:

1. IDS software suite for data collection and visualization.
2. RStudio for hands-on data analysis.

- IDS Web Browser Requirements
To facilitate data collection and visualization the following browsers are recommended: Chrome, Firefox.

- IDS UCLA Mobile App Requirements
Portable data collection is facilitated by The IDS UCLA mobile apps available on the Android and iOS devices: Android App (Android 5.1+ operating system), Apple iOS App (iOS 9.0+ operating system).

- RStudio Web Browser Requirements
RStudio is an external, open-source project, requiring the aforementioned browsers: Chrome, Firefox.


### Hardware Specifications

School district provided HP Chromebooks. 
HP Chromebooks specifications:
Standing screen display of 14 inches, processor of 2.16 GHz celeron_n3350, RAM of 4GB DDR3, memory speed of 2.16 GHz, hard drive of 32 GB Emmc, and average battery life of 9 hours.
Each student’s chromebook comes with its own charging cord, with two more assigned to the teacher as extras


### Application

**Assignment, Lab, and Project Management with Google Classroom:**

Each student has a student-district gmail account that joins the teacher’s Google Classroom in order to access from class or remotely (when absent) all announcements, assignments, lab response Google Documents, and project guidelines.

Lab response sheets as Google documents are submitted through Google Classroom. Due to the substantial number of varying levels of English learners and Special Education students, the original response sheet supplied by the IDS UCLA curriculum had to be comprehensively modified and scaffolded with our diverse students in mind. This was to ensure that the basic statistics concepts taught in the beginning lessons to support the data cycle process and coding would fit together as a big picture with real life applications.
 
**Data Collection with the Survey Taking  and Campaign Manager application:**

All students are assigned a username with a temporary password to the IDS portal (portal.idsucla.org) in order to utilize the Survey Taking app to answer questions from the pre-created campaigns of the curriculum. From this IDS portal they can monitor their submitted responses from the Campaign Manager, which is powered by xml codes. 

(https://wiki.idsucla.org/app/web/surveys)

When the survey taking window closes, and students are ready to analyze the collected data, one of the lab assignments focuses on taking them through a process known as “export, upload, and import”. The “export” step takes place from the Campaign Manager, which exports the collected data as a CSV file to the students’ Google drives. 

https://wiki.idsucla.org/app/web/surveys#choosing_a_campaign
 
**Analyze Collected Data and R coding on the Rstudio platform:**

Before students can begin coding, they must complete the “export, upload, and import” process. During the second month of instruction when students have established a basic starting foundation of statistics concepts, they use their student district emails to sign into their Rstudio cloud pages at [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). They create a new project page with their full names and class period in the title box at the top to make their project pages easier to manage for the teacher. 

For the upload and import process, students will use one of the four panels of the Rstudio platform that we call the “plots pane” under the Files tab to upload the collected data in CSV format from the Google drive to the Rstudio cloud. Then students will immediately import it in what is called the Environment pane of the Rstudio platform to make it immediately accessible for analysis by coding.

Analyzing data takes place by directly coding on the console pane of the platform and the initial labs and embedded tutorial guides students step by step with a given set of data to construct plots such as bar graphs and histograms. Students learn the importance of syntax, and for first-time coders this is an eye-opener. In the instance when a mistake is made, they learn to read the error or warning message that appears to aid them in troubleshooting and fixing their code.

With successive lab work going through the tutorials, students learn to filter and refine their collected data and then analyze the data collected from themselves and their peers of the same class period in order to answer statistical questions and find trends and connections.
 
**Assessments: Code Checks, illuminate Quizzes, Projects**

With periodic code checks, students are given a few-days notice of it and they are presented with a situation to satisfy from a given criteria of a specific type of plot and needed variables to a given refined plot from a data set the class that they then have to figure out the code to produce the given visual. These can be done with students pairing up for this informal assessment to earn shared points or individually upon teacher discretion. These informal assessment scenarios are also modified when needed for our special education students and English learners.

The school district has also subscribed to the online illuminate software that allows teachers to upload quizzes for students to take in a multiple choice format. This has been used as an additional tool to assess the comprehension of the statistics concepts and the related coding practiced. These formal assessment scenarios are also modified when needed for our special education students and English learners.

The long term projects proceed after the conclusion of a unit, and this combines the use of the IDS portal for its survey taking and campaign manager applications, which then lead to the use of the Rstudio platform for analysis through coding. All this culminates in a Google Slides presentation that follows our students (working as an individual or pair) choosing a relevant topic regarding teens (i.e. teen wellness) and formulating unique statistical questions that follow through the entire four steps of the data cycle. 

For this project, students must submit a relevant statistical question that is not similar to any other peers’ chosen question. Then they are instructed on how to use the Campaign Manager to construct their own set of single-choice format questions and numerical-input questions. While this function of the Campaign Manager is powered by xml coding, there is a user-friendly interface that does not require students to know this specific coding language. From there their peers answer their survey questions until enough data is gathered to “export, upload, and import”. The teams analyze and produce plots that will lead them towards an answer to their original statistical question and thus interpretation and conclusion. All this is carefully put together in Google slides format with explanations, captions, imported plots from the Rstudio platform to be presented on its presentation date


### Impacts

In this IDS course and with the dynamics of the school population I teach, accessibility is key. Not only does this course invite students who have never taken a Statistics or Computer Science course in high school, but this has become a class where for many students this is their last opportunity to see Math, specifically Statistics, and Coding merge together in a tangible and relatable manner. Most of the students enrolled have had grave struggles in the previous Integrated Math courses and thus enter this class predisposed to dread this hybrid of statistics and coding. On another front, many of the juniors and seniors have also been recommended by their guidance counselors to take this course due to their intimidation with pursuing the college preparatory math courses that follow Integrated Math 2 leading to Trigonometry and Calculus. Among the students are also individuals with Individual Education Plans (IEPs) who require scaffolded modifications and accommodations.
 
The technology of this course with the Rstudio coding platform and the IDS portal supported by the IDS UCLA team have been relatively student-friendly. The team has been cognizant of the diverse learning population we teach and has welcomed input and worked on the programming and maintenance side of the platforms as well as providing the tech support when the problems stem beyond a site based issue.
 
My campus has a tech support technician on site as well as a department of IT people to troubleshoot and solve the issues that are beyond a teacher’s reach to fix.
 
On a daily level, some of the issues have involved students not bringing their devices to school due to their forgetfulness or other reasons. My campus has set hours from the morning to noon with offices to check out loaner Chromebooks for the day as well as charging cables when needed. In the event of a device not working, students can also sign out for a loaner. 
 
As far as virtual education for IDS, this has been done during the 2020-2021 school year when the pandemic hit its high and closed down schools. At the time my school district had prepared itself to mobilize and distribute a chromebook to every single student. 
 
Students did connect well after the initial hiccups in the first few weeks of school with device distributions and students access the internet from home. 
 
In the event of a need to go virtual in the future, my school is prepared and my experience during that school year with the lockdown has taught me how to transition more smoothly and how to ensure students do the same.
 
The social transition and challenges can be eased with working technology and dependable tech support as well as teacher experience in troubleshooting so that students can feel they matter and that their access to the instruction is important. The resiliency can and has been encouraged through developing that connection even on a virtual basis, and with this course engaging a class for their feedback and input is important. The use of the Zoom application’s poll to survey students was and can still be an effective way to detect the culture and atmosphere of the class to gauge where motivation is needed. However, the IDS curriculum itself has been designed around utilizing the students’ input through data collection and so as a class students can express what they would like to learn from each other. Campaigns and surveys can be modified and even created from scratch to fit the students’ interests in order to bring meaningful dialogue that will still promote the purpose of this course that merges statistics with coding.
 
The legal challenges often come with meeting the need for access to all students. Whether teaching IDS in-person or virtually, teachers must meet the needs specified in a students’ IEP or a 504 student support plan with all the tools within a teacher and student’s access. The provisions of technological devices needed are the school site’s and district’s responsibility, and teachers work closely with the Special Education teachers who collaborate with the class and the case carriers that will update IEPs annually. 
 
Along those lines are also our English learners, for which there is a substantial population in my school district. All of our English learners, whether they are initially emerging learners to those who have progressed in a redesignated level, have to have their learning needs addressed also. Even though I am not an English teacher, I am also responsible in my district to input their progress in language acquisition which is done through the Power School platform. Student responses in writing using Google Forms, and written lesson reflections submitted as Google Docs in Google classroom provide those writing samples to aid in this documentation.
 
As this course has evolved and will evolve, the IDS UCLA team has provided updated data sets. In the first two lab assignments, IDS students are led through an analysis of coding to learn about teens in their age group. This amassed data set is updated periodically. In the lab done earlier this school year, our students used a data set gathered by the CDC in 2019 from over 10,000 teenagers. In the same manner, I have a second semester project based on smart phone usage, but the survey questions are updated based on the trends and new applications that change yearly. This is how this class stays relevant and not stale, and this makes this course relatable and the coding more meaningful. To the average student who has never coded, it is important to show them in this course that we are not coding for the sake of coding, but to understand the world around us through data. This way numbers and data take on a more tangible meaning that our students can understand in real life.
