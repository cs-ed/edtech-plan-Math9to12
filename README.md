# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology plan is meant to provide accessibility for students to learn coding with ease of availability of needed devices and electronic accessibility, in-person support, and online resources while also applying the foundational concepts of Mathematics like Statistics.


## Context

### Course

This course introduces statistical analysis and computer science principles (coding).  Using inquiry-driven lessons, students are encouraged to ask critical questions about their world, create surveys, and collect data using technology and mobile devices.  Students will analyze and visualize data using the “R” programming language.  By the end of this course they will have explored and participated in the four stages of the Data Cycle: (1) ask a statistical question, (2) collect data, (3) analyze data, and (4) interpret data. 

Introduction to Data Science is available to 11th-12th grade students as a math course and elective.


### Situation

This course was originally designed by IDS UCLA for students who have already taken high school Statistics in mind, however my school district has made this accessible to all juniors and seniors so Statistics is not a prerequisite.

For the vast majority of students entering this class, this is the first comprehensive student experience in coding. With many novice coders, students who have not had a foreknowledge of Statistics from the course, and individuals who have had discouraging experiences in the Integrated Math 1 and Integrated Math 2 courses, IDS has become the most tangible and relatable the juniors and seniors will experience. Another significant concern has been making this course more accessible for our Special Education students and our English Learners since all of the IDS classes follow an inclusion model. 

With the inexperienced coders as well as the Special Education students and English Learners in mind, my school district has provided all the relevant technology along with the support of our collaboration teachers and instructional aides, but it is the guidance and human interaction that will connect our students to this worthwhile course by initially turning juniors and seniors into participatory sensors. Motivation and interest is stirred up based on the design of this curriculum, but connecting our students to coding R-language coding platform known as Rstudio has taken a bit of time. Students, depending on their own comfort levels have had varying lengths of time to get accustomed to doing the lab work. Collaboration among students working in pairs and one-on-one between the teacher or aide and the coder will be among the strategies to be utilized. For our English learners, the collaboration pairing will be crucial to overcome some of the language barriers as well as the understandable cultural adjustment to a new setting.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
